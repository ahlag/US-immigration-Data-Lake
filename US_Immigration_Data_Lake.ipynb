    "## Data Engineering Capstone Project\n",
    "### Goal: To support U.S Customs & Border Protection Department to make better decisions on Immigration Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this data engineering capstone project is to give students a chance to combine what they've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of learners portfolio that will help to achieve data engineering-related career goals. We could choose to complete the project provided by the Udacity team or define the scope and data ourselves. I took the first approach in building the Data Lake on the data on immigration to the United States provided by Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A business consulting firm specialized in data warehouse services through assisting the enterprises with navigating their data needs and creating strategic operational solutions that deliver tangible business results is contacted by U.S Customs & Border Protection Department. Specifically, they want help with the modernization of department's data warehousing infrastructure by improving performance and ease of use for end users, enhancing functionality, decreasing total cost of ownership while making it possible for real-time decision making. In total, the department is asking for a full suite of services includes helping department with data profiling, data standardization, data acquisition, data transformation and integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection needs help to see what is hidden behind the data flood. As more and more immigrants move to the US, people want quick and reliable ways to access certain information that can help inform their immigration, such as weather of the destination, demographics of destination. And for regulators to keep track of immigrants and their immigration meta data such as visa type, visa expire date, entry method to the US. The consulting firm aim to model and create a brand new analytics solution on top of the state-of-the-art technolgies available to enable department to unleash insights from data then making better decisions on immigration policies for those who came and will be coming in near future to the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows the follow steps:\n",
    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",
    "* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data\n",
    "* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up"

    "\n",
    "### The Scope\n",
    "The main deliverable of the work here will be a Data Lake in the cloud that will support answering questions through analytics tables and dashboards. Additionally, as a general source-of-truth database is developed, the U.S Customs & Border Protection Department could open the solution through a web API so backend web services could query the warehouse for information relating to international visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "For this work, the I-94 Immigration Dataset, the Global Temperature Dataset and U.S. City Demographic Dataset are used. The descriptions contained in the I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS file is taken into account as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Architecture\n",
    "The whole solution is cloud based on top of **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. First, all the datasets were preprocessed with **Apache Spark** and stored in a staging area in **AWS S3** bucket. Then, it is loaded into a **Amazon Redshift** cluster using an Apache Airflow pipeline that transfers and checks the quality of the data to finally provide the department a Data Lake for their convenient analysis."

    "\n",
    "For decades, U.S. immigration officers issued the I-94 Form (Arrival/Departure Record) to foreign visitors (e.g., business visitors, tourists and foreign students) who lawfully entered the United States. The I-94 was a small white paper form that a foreign visitor received from cabin crews on arrival flights and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of entry into the United States. It listed the traveler's immigration category, port of entry, data of entry into the United States, status expiration date and had a unique 11-digit identifying number assigned to it. Its purpose was to record the traveler's lawful admission to the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main dataset and there is a file for each month of the year of 2016 available in the directory ../../data/18-83510-I94-Data-2016/ in the SAS binary database storage format sas7bdat. Combined, the 12 datasets have got more than 40 million rows (40,790,529) and 28 columns. For most of the work, only the month of April of 2016 data is used which has more than three million records (3,096,313)."

As this represent the facts of what needs to be analysed - U.S Immigrators from the world -, this was transformed to the **fact table IMMIGRATION** as represented in the schema below. This data was given the most of the focus during the modeling phase. The immigration dataset is also the data source for the **DATE dimension table**. Extraction of all the distinct values of the columns arrdate and depdate applied and various functions were applied to store in the table a number of attributes of a particular date: day, month, year, week of year and day of week.\n",

Median Age, Male Population, Female Population, Total Population, Number of Veterans, Foreign-born were first aggregated by City using first function, since they are repeated accross the different rows of the same city. Then, the resulting rows were grouped by State applying the sum function in the numeric columns to make a cosolidated total in each U.S State. The column Race needed to be transformed in order to make its different values to become different columns. It was achieved by usig the pivot function of the pyspark package. As a result a final structure was reached where the columns (BlackOrAfricanAmerican, White, ForeignBorn, AmericanIndianAndAlaskaNative, HispanicOrLatino, Asian, NumberVeterans, FemalePopulation, MalePopulation, TotalPopulation) were obtained for each of the states of the U.S.\n",

Firstly, the key-value pairs are extracted from the I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS and were saved in csv files in the lookup directory. Following the temperature dataset is aggregated by City and then by Country. Finally, these two intermediary results were joined to form the table COUNTRY.\n",
